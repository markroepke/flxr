# flxr: An R package for scraping movie data <img src="tools/flxr.png" align="right" width="120" height="139" />

This package allows users to easily scrape movie data from the internet. By only supplying a movie title, users can currently retrieve the movie description, director, lead cast, genre, runtime, IMDB user rating, and Metacritic rating. The package can currently be installed using the following code:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("markroepke/flxr")
library(flxr)
```

Here is an example of `flxr` in use:

```{r}
# Get movie director
flx_mov_director("The Godfather")
```

There is also broad function, `flx_mov_details()` for easily pulling all movie information.

```{r}
# Get movie information
flx_mov_details("The Godfather")
```
